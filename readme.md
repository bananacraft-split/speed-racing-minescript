# Installation

1. Run the game once to fully load everything.
1. Put this repository into the `minescript` folder in the instance's directory

# Usage

Documentation is lacking at the moment.

`\maketrack` will make a track, you will have to manually finish the selector though.
The instructions for the checkpoints are currently oudated -- you will have to refer to the code to see how it works at the moment.

`\movelb` moves a leaderboard.

`\rendercp` can re-render killed checkpoint markers

`\resetlb` can reset a leaderboard

That's really all that should be needed
